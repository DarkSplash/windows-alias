# windows-alias
This repo initially was supposed to contains a cmd aliases for shortening commands and other handy scripts for Windows I have written, but has expanded to a bunch of random windows scripts I have written over the years.  Kinda just a grabbag repo to either quickly grab a script I remember making previously or a place to reference scripting languages I may not use too frequently.

Tutorial I followed for adding scripts to PATH (specifically for the batch scripts): https://stackoverflow.com/a/39459404
